## ★ RESOLVED USER DECISION (was: "read this first")

- **Deeper creative scoring (`creative.py::_KIND_SCORES`) — RESOLVED via P-012
  (option B, penalty-only).** The user chose **option B**: a bounded, transparent,
  capped, **penalty-only** evidence-nudge layer ON TOP of the curated table (the
  `_KIND_SCORES` VALUES are UNCHANGED). Shipped — `score_variant` applies two
  evidence-gated `vocal_belief` penalties (`−8` masked vocal across
  `width_bloom`/`vocal_ride`/`intimacy_pass`; `−6` `width_crowding` for
  `width_bloom`), the summed overall delta clamped to `±2.0`, `score_nudges`
  emitted only on fire. It DELIBERATELY changes default scoring when a nudge fires
  but provably cannot overturn a clear base ranking (cap 2.0 < 2.4–4.2 base gaps).
  **NOW MERGED to default via PR #13 (merge commit `0f4e7e9`)** — the user's
  reviewed aesthetic change is live. **P-013 (tests-only) then proved the nudge
  fires on REAL DATA through the live `analyze()` path** (`dense_chorus_with_loops`
  emits a real `width_crowding` event → row-2 nudge fires; overall_score
  75.7→74.9; winner unchanged — option (a)), closing the golden-unguarded gap.
  Receipts: `build-os/receipts/P-012-creative-scoring-nudge-layer.md`,
  `build-os/receipts/P-013-nudge-visibility-fixture.md`. (Options (a) leave
  as-is and (c) fuller song-derived rescoring were NOT chosen.)

- **THE BASE-VALUE RE-CURATION LEVER IS PROBED AND THE JUDGMENT LAYER IS AT A
  DOCTRINE-HONEST EQUILIBRIUM (P-017).** The user chose "A" -- attempt the FIRST
  change to a base `_KIND_SCORES` value (re-curate `depth_cleanup` so the
  depth/hierarchy move wins the `density` branch). **FINDING: an honest re-curation
  CANNOT flip `density` -- arithmetically forced by the doctrine, verified
  adversarially. `_KIND_SCORES` LEFT UNTOUCHED (no product change).** THREE
  independent levers have now converged on the same place: penalty (P-012/P-015),
  reward/promotion (P-016), and base-value re-curation (P-017) all confirm that
  `subtractive_drop`'s default dominance is legitimate, the masked-vocal near-tie
  (P-015) and foregrounded-loop promotion (P-016) are the ONLY doctrinally-warranted
  flips, and **there is NO honest further flip move inside the current dimension
  set.** The evidence/re-curation program to make judgment decisive is essentially
  COMPLETE. The one remaining honest thread is a SYMMETRIC re-judgment (is
  `subtractive_drop` itself slightly over-valued?) -- user-gated, un-signed-off, NOT
  staged. Receipt: `build-os/receipts/P-017-doctrine-honest-kind-scores-recuration.md`.

## Deferred (follow-up packets)

- **★★ THE TIMBALAND SUB-ARC (P-032.x) IS UNDERWAY — P-032e ✓ (beat_identity —
  the front-loaded CRUX) + P-032a ✓ (negative_space) LANDED.** The user
  front-loaded the hardest/riskiest axis (P-032e) to de-risk the whole sub-arc;
  P-032a then took the LOWEST-RISK remaining axis. Both add a new
  producer-agnostic doctrine axis weight-0 for halee_ramone → byte-identical,
  proving the P-029 architecture is EXTENSIBLE, not just parameterizable. **The
  engine now carries 9 component axes** (7 original + beat_identity +
  negative_space). Receipts: `build-os/receipts/P-032e-beat-identity.md`,
  `build-os/receipts/P-032a-negative-space.md`. **Carry-forwards:**
  - **★ NEXT IN THE SUB-ARC — P-032b (groove_coherence live-wire) — the RISKIER
    packet.** It relocates `analyze_groove` to BEFORE `score_doctrine` and threads
    it in (the P-016 live-wire lesson: an evidence-gated signal is only live if
    computed BEFORE its consumer — needs a no-re-run live-wire test asserting on
    real `analyze()` output), THEN adds the groove-coherence scorer. This is where
    onset-regularity/IOI (deferred from P-032e AND P-032a) finally reaches
    doctrine. Sub-arc sequence: **P-032e ✓ → P-032a ✓** → P-032b (groove_coherence
    live-wire — NEXT) → P-032c (low_end_motion/pocket) → P-032d (rhythmic_surprise,
    weak-form) → P-032f (vocal-role refinement) → P-032g (loop static-vs-iconic
    context) → **[fold P-031 confidence here]** → P-032h (author `timbaland.json`,
    the first non-byte-identical output) → P-032i (Timbaland-vs-Halee/Ramone
    differential proof). P-030 (rename dims) orthogonal/last.
  - **★ NEW LIVENESS-DOCSTRING OVERCLAIM (non-blocking, from P-032a — reviewer):**
    the two `liveness` test docstrings in `tests/test_negative_space.py` (~lines
    536-540, 553-557) OVERCLAIM — a general hardcoded-constant sabotage is actually
    caught by the *discrimination* tests, not the liveness tests themselves (the
    direction test reads the score from the SAME reference dict a constant poisons).
    The SAME imprecision exists in the already-closed `tests/test_beat_identity.py`.
    **Cosmetic only** (the guard SET as a whole is sound) — fold a one-line
    docstring fix for BOTH files into a future doctrine-touching packet.
  - **★ DOCSTRING DRIFT (non-blocking, from P-032e):** `_beat_identity`'s docstring
    says candidacy is "optionally corroborated by crest/spectral_flatness" but the
    body reads only `crest_factor_db`, never `spectral_flatness`. The spec made
    flatness OPTIONAL, so this is HARMLESS — **fold a one-line docstring fix into a
    future doctrine-touching packet** rather than spending a commit now. Not a bug.
  - **★ HONEST DEFERRALS baked into the sub-arc (documented in-code as P-014-style
    boundaries, NOT faked — do NOT let a later packet quietly claim them):** from
    P-032e — (1) fingerprint TYPING (mouth-sound/tabla/synth-knock), not measurable
    on exported stems; (2) onset REGULARITY / IOI — real but not visible at
    `score_doctrine` time (post-doctrine groove analyzer) → **P-032b**'s live-wire;
    (3) "more undeniable after a move" — needs a before/after render, plan-only v1
    out of scope. From P-032a — sample-level **inter-onset silence gaps** (space
    between individual hits) need onset timing, not visible at `score_doctrine`
    time → **P-032b**'s groove live-wire; negative_space works at the
    section-aggregate grain only.

- **★★ THE ACTIVE ROADMAP IS THE PRODUCER-AGNOSTIC EPIC — P-025 ✓ (foundation) +
  P-026 ✓ (creative sourced) + P-027 ✓ (governance sourced + WIDENED) + P-028 ✓
  (doctrine sourced + WIDENED — the EXTRACTION PHASE is COMPLETE) + P-029 ✓
  (THE PIVOT — `analyze(producer=…)` selects the profile; it is now a LIVE,
  SELECTABLE LEVER end-to-end; architecture complete & validated).** Make the
  engine select any producer's judgment as a
  swappable `ProducerProfile` (the physics stays fixed). **P-025 ✓** extracted
  today's 100%-hardcoded Halee/Ramone judgment into a frozen `ProducerProfile` + a
  pure `load_profile()` + the VERBATIM `halee_ramone.json` reference, byte-identical
  round-trip-guarded, honesty-metadata-stamped, **COMPLETELY UNWIRED**. **P-026 ✓**
  made `creative.py` the FIRST consumer: it now SOURCES its 8 producer-specific
  globals (`_KIND_SCORES`, `_NUDGE_TABLE`, `_PROMOTION_TABLE`, `CREATIVE_NUDGE_CAP`,
  `CREATIVE_PROMOTION_CAP`, `_RISK_PENALTY`, `SEARCH_MODES`, `PHILOSOPHY`) FROM
  `load_profile("halee_ramone")` — the hardcoded literals DELETED, so
  `halee_ramone.json` is now their single source of truth. Byte-identical (the
  P-012/13/15/16 creative tests pass UNEDITED, 69 combined; regression 68/68
  UNCHANGED), no-aliasing-proven (copy-before-mutate; profile byte-unchanged after a
  nudge + promotion fire). Single commit `c4a092d`; suite 319 → 331 (+12). **P-027 ✓**
  sourced `governance.py` from the profile (`_TRUTH_ALIGNMENT` / `_TASTE_KIND_BIAS` /
  `TASTE_MAX_DELTA` + the 4 AESTHETIC kill-switches) AND WIDENED the profile
  (Finding A) with `taste_triangle` (`intimate_width_penalty: 30` + `emotion_dims`) +
  `veto_thresholds` (`reject_below: 45` / `align_veto_below: 50` / `align_fallback:
  75`), now sourced too. The 5 SAFETY kill-switches STAY hardcoded
  (`_SAFETY_KILL_SWITCHES`) — producer-AGNOSTIC. Byte-identical (existing
  governance/taste tests pass UNEDITED; emotion-blend round() proven byte-identical
  across all 1,030,301 integer triples; regression 68/68 UNCHANGED), no-aliasing
  DISCHARGED (mutation local-only; shared profile byte-unchanged). Two commits
  `e4786ca` (green in isolation = 343) + `7b1c26d`; suite 331 → 351 (+20). **P-028 ✓**
  sourced `doctrine_engine.py` from the profile (all 8 scorers: Part A the
  P-025-captured `weights` + `_halee`/`_ramone` baselines/coeffs; Part B WIDENED the
  profile with `doctrine.scorers` — 5 function groups — and sourced them) while the
  PHYSICS/measurement code + presentation thresholds (`stereo_width > 0.6`,
  `distinct <= 1`, `score < 55`) STAY hardcoded (producer-AGNOSTIC). Byte-identical
  (existing doctrine tests UNEDITED; regression 68/68 UNCHANGED; reviewer confirmed
  live `doctrine_score` byte-matches the golden on all 3 fixtures incl.
  `overall_mix_readiness_score`), round-trip NON-VACUOUS (18→17 flip fails +
  shifts `_section_contrast` 64→66), no-aliasing DISCHARGED. Two commits `29b9dfe`
  (green in isolation = 364) + `72e98a7`; suite 351 → 370 (+19). **P-028 COMPLETES the
  EXTRACTION PHASE — the whole judgment layer is now profile-driven, byte-identical,
  physics chassis separate.** Receipts:
  `build-os/receipts/P-025-producer-profile-schema-loader-halee-ramone-extraction.md`,
  `build-os/receipts/P-026-creative-sources-values-from-reference-profile.md`,
  `build-os/receipts/P-027-governance-sources-values-from-reference-profile.md`,
  `build-os/receipts/P-028-doctrine-sources-values-from-reference-profile.md`.
  **The epic arc (next steps):**
  - **P-027 — governance extraction (WIDENED per Finding A + ALIASING-PROOF) — ✓
    DONE.** `governance.py` sources `_TRUTH_ALIGNMENT` / `_TASTE_KIND_BIAS` /
    `TASTE_MAX_DELTA` + the 4 AESTHETIC kill-switches from the profile; the profile
    widened with `taste_triangle` + `veto_thresholds`, now sourced; the 5 SAFETY
    kill-switches STAY hardcoded (producer-agnostic). Aliasing-proof DISCHARGED.
  - **P-028 — doctrine extraction (WIDENED per Finding A + ALIASING-PROOF) — ✓
    DONE.** `doctrine_engine.py` sources ALL 8 scorers' aesthetic constants from the
    profile — Part A the P-025-captured `weights` + `_halee`/`_ramone` baselines
    (86.0) + penalty coeffs; Part B WIDENED the profile with a `doctrine.scorers`
    group (5 function groups: `_vocal_centrality` / `_depth_hierarchy` /
    `_section_contrast` / `_static_mix` / `_dynamic_mix`) captured VERBATIM and
    sourced. The PHYSICS/measurement code + presentation thresholds STAY hardcoded.
    Byte-identical (regression 68/68 UNCHANGED + `doctrine_score` byte-match),
    round-trip non-vacuous, aliasing-proof DISCHARGED. **Extraction phase COMPLETE.**
  - **P-029 — parameterize the pipeline by a per-call producer (THE PIVOT) — ✓ DONE.**
    `pipeline.analyze(..., producer="halee_ramone")` accepts a NAME or a
    `ProducerProfile` object (isinstance dispatch), loads ONCE per call, and threads
    `profile=` to `score_doctrine` / `run_creative_engine` / `run_governance`, which
    thread it to ALL leaf scorers; each reads its producer-specific values from the
    PASSED profile, defaulting to `_DEFAULT_PROFILE` when `None`. KILL_SWITCHES
    recomposed per call = 5 hardcoded SAFETY + profile aesthetic (a producer can never
    drop a safety guarantee). Byte-identical default (reviewer independently
    byte-diffed all 3 layers × 3 fixtures → IDENTICAL; regression 68/68 UNCHANGED);
    selection GENUINELY LIVE + load-bearing across doctrine (baseline −20 → halee_score
    delta 20), creative (kind_score boost → overall 100), governance
    (truth_alignment 88→60 → governed 60), all through the REAL analyze() path, proven
    both ways (sabotage fails the liveness test while byte-identical stays green — the
    P-016 lesson). Two commits `42d6ebd` (green in isolation = 383) + `ea1aaa9`; suite
    370 → 384 (+14). Codex NOT available — single-reviewer. **P-029 does NOT remove the
    `_DEFAULT_PROFILE` singleton** — it stays as the `None`-default fallback in all 3
    modules, so the per-module aliasing discipline still carries on the default path
    (carry-forward for P-032). Receipt:
    `build-os/receipts/P-029-parameterize-pipeline-by-per-call-producer-profile.md`.
  - **P-030 — rename** the `halee` / `ramone` dimension names off the producer
    names (they were kept verbatim in P-025 per the byte-identical-first decision).
  - **P-031 — confidence framework:** consume the profile metadata stamp
    (provenance / confidence / risk_class) per the confirmed honesty policy.
  - **P-032 — second producer** (a real non-Halee/Ramone profile — the first test
    of true producer-agnosticism; governed by the honesty policy).
  - **P-033 — expose producer selection** (the user-facing selection surface).

- **★ FINDING A — SECONDARY PRODUCER-AESTHETIC CONSTANTS (reviewer, from P-025;
  deferred by design, NOT drift). ✓ NOW FULLY RESOLVED (governance ✓ P-027; doctrine
  ✓ P-028).** P-025 captured what its scope declared; the remaining producer-specific
  constants have now ALL been captured:
  - **→ P-027 (governance): ✓ RESOLVED.** The profile holds `taste_triangle`
    (`intimate_width_penalty: 30` + `emotion_dims: [ramone_score,
    listener_excitement_score, vocal_belief_score]`) + `veto_thresholds`
    (`reject_below: 45` / `align_veto_below: 50` / `align_fallback: 75`), all sourced +
    round-trip-guarded, byte-identical.
  - **→ P-028 (doctrine): ✓ RESOLVED.** The profile's new `doctrine.scorers` group
    holds ALL 5 remaining scoring functions' constants — `_vocal_centrality`
    (no_lead 35.0 / baseline 70.0 / bonuses 10,10 / masked_coeff 6), `_depth_hierarchy`
    (baseline 40 / per_distinct 12 / forward_threshold 0.6 / forward_occupancy 60),
    `_section_contrast` (baseline 100 / lift_fail_penalty 18), `_static_mix` (baseline
    80.0 / peak_ceiling -0.1 / peak_penalty 10 / dominant_band_threshold 0.55 /
    dominant_band_penalty 10 / crit_low_coeff 8 / no_lead_penalty 8), `_dynamic_mix`
    (insufficient_sections_score 40.0 / baseline 30 / rms_coeff 8 / width_coeff 140 /
    bright_coeff 140 / lift_fail_penalty 10), captured VERBATIM and sourced,
    byte-identical.
  **Finding A carries NO remaining deferred capture** — the reference profile now
  fully drives creative + governance + doctrine.

- **★ ALIASING-PROOF REQUIREMENT — ✓ DISCHARGED for ALL THREE consumer modules
  (creative P-026, governance P-027, doctrine P-028); a PER-MODULE invariant, NOT a
  structural guarantee (reviewer, from P-026).** P-026 proved `creative.py`
  copy-before-mutate (`kind_scores` byte-unchanged after a nudge + promotion fire).
  **P-027 DISCHARGED it for governance** (mutation local to `triangle`; shared
  `_DEFAULT_PROFILE` byte-unchanged after a fixture run). **P-028 DISCHARGED it for
  doctrine:** grep confirmed no in-place mutation of the sourced structures; the
  no-aliasing test runs `score_doctrine` on a fixture (+ crafted multi-penalty inputs)
  and asserts the shared `_DEFAULT_PROFILE` structures are byte-unchanged afterward;
  determinism holds. **So all three per-module proofs are in.** **★ UPDATE (P-029):
  P-029 threaded a per-call profile BUT DID NOT remove the module `_DEFAULT_PROFILE`
  singleton** — it remains the `None`-default fallback in all 3 consumer modules, so
  the shared-mutable-global still exists on the DEFAULT path and the per-module
  copy-before-mutate discipline STILL CARRIES. **CARRY-FORWARD for P-032:** when a
  SECOND live profile is loaded per call, keep the aliasing discipline in mind — do
  NOT mutate a loaded profile's structures in place. The full structural removal of
  the singleton is not yet done. **★ REINFORCED by
  P-032e AND P-032a:** both new scorers (`_beat_identity`, `_negative_space`) only
  READ `doctrine[...]` and never mutate the profile, each guarded by a no-aliasing
  test — so the per-module copy-before-mutate discipline still holds. When a SECOND
  live profile is loaded per call (P-032h authors `timbaland.json`), do NOT mutate a
  loaded profile's structures in place.

- **★ TRAILER-SPEC STANDING NOTE — DROP the "NO model identifier" line from FUTURE
  packet specs (from P-027; reconciled).** The reviewer repeatedly re-flags the
  mandated `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8` trailer as a "model identifier,"
  conflicting with packet-spec lines that say "NO model identifier in any commit
  message/artifact." **RECONCILED — there is NO violation:** the harness / `CLAUDE.md`
  MANDATE that exact trailer session-wide; "Claude Opus 4.8" is the SANCTIONED trailer
  form, DISTINCT from the exact model ID the identity rule bars. **Action for P-028+
  spec authors:** OMIT the "NO model identifier" constraint line — it conflicts with
  the mandated trailer and keeps tripping the reviewer. The required trailers
  (`Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8` + `Claude-Session: …`) are correct and expected.

- **★ WATCH-ITEM — `emotion_dims` couples the profile to `scores` dict keys (reviewer,
  from P-027; mild).** P-027's widened `taste_triangle.emotion_dims`
  (`["ramone_score", "listener_excitement_score", "vocal_belief_score"]`) couples the
  profile to the exact key names in the runtime `scores` dict. Byte-identical and
  correct today, but **watch this coupling when P-028 generalizes scoring and when
  P-029 threads the profile per-call** — any rename/restructure of the score keys must
  stay in lockstep with `emotion_dims`.

- **★ CONFIRMED HONESTY / SOURCING POLICY — a STANDING product decision governing
  P-031 / P-032 (confirmed by the user).** hand-curated → high-confidence;
  derived → low-confidence (labeled); LLM → draft-only, NEVER high-confidence. The
  `halee_ramone` reference is `hand-curated-documented` → `high` / `risk_class 0`,
  consistent with the policy. The profile metadata stamp exists now (P-025) but is
  not enforced / propagated until P-031; authoring a SECOND profile (P-032) must
  obey this policy (no LLM-authored profile may claim `high` confidence).

- **★ THE ARC IS DOWN TO ITS LAST STEP — P-024 (MCP SERVER, option C step 2).**
  Canonical target: Logic Mix OS as a tool Claude Cowork can drive END-TO-END in a
  Logic Pro mixing session (plan-only v1). **P-019 ✓** closed the learning loop
  INSIDE the cowork surface (`record_mix_pass`, read/write symmetric); **P-020 ✓**
  made the surface self-describing as an ordered, phase-grouped session flow
  (`describe_session`, completeness invariant load-bearing); **P-021 ✓ (the
  MILESTONE)** PROVED, executably, that an agent driving ONLY the cowork surface
  completes a full plan-only session AND closes the learning loop within the surface
  (load-bearing + non-tautological); **P-023 ✓ (option C step 1)** turned the raw-CLI
  transport into a VERSIONED, SELF-DESCRIBING contract (`describe_contract`, registry
  35, inspect-derived params, honest side_effect making live-vs-dead a first-class
  contract fact, + `COWORK_CONTRACT.md`). The user chose **option C (sequenced):
  documented raw-CLI contract now [P-023, done], MCP server as the follow-on
  [P-024].** **So the canonical target is essentially MET at the decision-system
  level and the transport is now a documented, versioned contract;** the ONLY
  remaining step is:
  - **P-024 — the ONLY remaining arc step (option C step 2, the FINAL step): a thin
    MCP server wrapping the SAME cowork registry.** Reuse `describe_contract`'s
    per-command `params` / `side_effect` metadata DIRECTLY as the MCP tool schemas
    (do NOT re-derive). **Fold in the P-023 carry-forward version-fingerprint
    guard** — a test pinning a hash of the contract surface so any change to
    `params` / `side_effect` forces a conscious `API_VERSION` decision (closes the
    reviewer watch-item that the hand-maintained version can silently lag the
    surface). Architecture/transport fork — confirm active via the orchestrator; do
    NOT open blind. **After P-024 the arc is COMPLETE; landing the accumulated
    P-017-guard → P-024 work on default is the natural close (USER-GATED).**
  - **P-022 — OPTIONAL / UNNEEDED.** The P-021 honesty clause surfaced NO real gap
    requiring session-efficiency / override-propagation work. Do NOT open unless a
    concrete gap emerges.

- **P-023 CARRY-FORWARD (non-blocking reviewer watch-item, for P-024):** the
  contract's `params` and `side_effect` cannot drift from the code (inspect-derived
  / verified against handler bodies), BUT `API_VERSION` is a hand-maintained string
  with NO test that fails when the surface changes without a version bump — so the
  declared VERSION can silently lag a surface change. **P-024 is where to add the
  version-fingerprint guard.** Minor note (NOT a bug): `update_taste_calibration`
  exposes `[label, context]` via inspect — MORE honest than the hand-written `desc`
  "(params: label)"; the inspect derivation is the truthful one.

- **✓ RESOLVED by P-021, then ELEVATED TO A CONTRACT FACT by P-023 — the
  LIVE-vs-DEAD distinction** (was the P-020 carry-forward reviewer flag). P-021's
  live-vs-dead test asserts, on the real surface, that `write_mix_decision` (the
  display-only DEAD `decision_ledger.json`, runtime-verified) does NOT change
  `suggest_next_pass`, whereas `record_mix_pass` (the LIVE history channel →
  `_apply_history`) DOES — only `record_mix_pass` closes the loop. **P-023 then made
  this a FIRST-CLASS CONTRACT FIELD:** `describe_contract`'s `side_effect` declares
  each write honestly — `record_mix_pass` → `writes:history(live)`,
  `update_taste_calibration` → `writes:taste(live)`, `write_mix_decision` →
  `writes:ledger(dead)`, `override_track_identity` → `mutates:session`, all other 31
  `none` (verified against handler bodies by qa + reviewer). So the distinction is no
  longer merely telegraphed by `desc` strings or only executably pinned by a test —
  it is a declared, machine-readable contract fact a future agent/reader cannot
  mistake. Ties into the standing LEDGER-IS-DEAD routing guard below.

- **Reward-nudges family — NOW CLOSED as SATURATED / EQUILIBRIUM (P-017).**
  P-016 shipped the FIRST reward/promotion nudge (the `loop` branch:
  `loop_deconstruct` promoted +4.0 past `subtractive_drop` when a loop is
  genuinely foregrounded), evidence-gated and LIVE in production, and it MERGED via
  PR #15. **But the further-reward-rows thread is now CLOSED:** the reward layer is
  saturated at cap 4.0 — only `loop` (gap 3.43) was cleanly reachable; `density`
  (gap 4.14) is unreachable + circular-gated; `drum_room_bloom` is hollow (no
  evidence signal). And P-017 confirmed the base-value re-curation lever cannot
  honestly flip `density` either. The three levers (penalty, reward, base-value)
  have all converged on a DOCTRINE-HONEST EQUILIBRIUM: **there is no honest further
  flip move inside the current dimension set.** Should the user ever ask for a NEW
  reward row anyway, it would still be user-gated per-row and must clear the SAME
  bar as P-016 (its own evidence gate + a non-vacuity mutation check + a
  collateral-safety proof + a live-wire check: evidence computed BEFORE
  `run_creative_engine`; asserted on the real `result.creative`/`result.governance`
  with NO re-run) — but this is no longer an in-flight candidate.
- **Near-tie-creative-FLIP fixture — RESOLVED-as-UNREACHABLE (P-014 verified
  negative finding).** This was the reachable-deferred complement to P-013's
  no-flip case; **P-014 proved a flip is structurally UNREACHABLE test-only**
  under the current `_KIND_SCORES` / `_NUDGE_TABLE`. The builder wrote ZERO code
  (honesty clause); qa adversarially CONFIRMED with THREE independent harnesses
  (inline-math, real-`score_variant`, saturated worst-case `masking_report`) —
  **all 0 flips** — plus a source re-derivation. Two structural reasons: the
  universal branch leader `subtractive_drop` (85.29) is in NO nudge row →
  penalty-immune; the one sub-cap near-tie branch (`vocal_belief`, gap 1.71)
  penalizes leader (`vocal_ride`) and runner-up (`intimacy_pass`) equally
  (identical row-0 `lead_masked −8`). **No longer a reachable candidate** — it is
  replaced by the user-gated curation packet directly below. Receipt:
  `build-os/receipts/P-014-near-tie-creative-flip-fixture.md`. (The P-014
  harnesses live in scratchpad — not committed.)
- **Make-the-nudge-decisive (curation change) — RESOLVED by P-015 (user-signed-off
  PRODUCT change).** The user chose "Option 1 — Proceed, corrected" (2026-06-30)
  and P-015 actioned route (a): `creative.py` `_NUDGE_TABLE` row-0 now **exempts
  `intimacy_pass`** and **strengthens the penalty `−8` → `−14`** (= −2.0 overall =
  the cap), so the `vocal_belief` 1.71-gap near-tie now FLIPS `vocal_ride` (vocal_A)
  → `intimacy_pass` (vocal_B) within the ±2.0 cap. The nudge is **no longer
  transparency-only** — it is decisive on exactly that near-tie, still bounded so it
  cannot overturn a clear ranking. Receipt:
  `build-os/receipts/P-015-decisive-masked-vocal-nudge.md`. **No remaining work
  here.**
- **Reviewer trajectory flag (from P-015 — non-blocking, watch-item):** the P-015
  flip margin is **thin (0.2)**, but it is **fully pinned by binding tests**
  (`tests/test_decisive_nudge.py`: flip + load-bearing negative control + collateral
  safety; updated `tests/test_creative_nudges.py`). A future re-curation of the
  creative scoring would surface as a **RED test, not a silent re-rank** — the
  golden-unguarded variant-scoring path is covered by these unit/flip tests. Carry
  this awareness into any future `creative.py` / `_NUDGE_TABLE` / `_KIND_SCORES`
  touch.
- **Reviewer watch-item (from P-016 — non-blocking, standing) — REWARD-CREEP:**
  P-016 crossed the penalty-only line with the FIRST reward nudge. Any FUTURE
  reward row must clear the same bar P-016 did: its own evidence gate + a
  non-vacuity mutation check + a collateral-safety proof + a **live-wire check**.
  Watch the trajectory — reward nudges are additive pressure on the default
  recommendation; keep each one bounded (a separate `CREATIVE_PROMOTION_CAP`),
  evidence-gated, and user-gated per-row.
- **★ STANDING LESSON (from P-016 — the P-009-style catch):** an evidence-gated
  creative nudge is only LIVE if its evidence is computed BEFORE
  `run_creative_engine`. In P-016, Commit-1's promotion was INERT in production —
  `run_creative_engine` ran before `provenance`/`source_audits` were populated, so
  the predicate always read empty evidence; the tests passed only because they
  RE-RAN the engine on the finished result (masking the inertness). Commit-2's
  live-wire (relocate `analyze_provenance` + `audit_all` just before
  `run_creative_engine`, a pure relocation) fixed it, guarded by two
  production-liveness tests that assert on the real `analyze()`
  `result.creative`/`result.governance` with NO re-run (FAIL pre-reorder, PASS
  after). Masking is pre-creative so P-015 was always live; provenance/source_audits
  were post-creative until P-016. **Rule:** for any future creative nudge, add a
  no-re-run liveness assertion — a green re-run test can mask production inertness.
- **Taste-flip through `analyze()` — STRUCTURALLY UNREACHABLE test-only
  (P-013 finding); a flip is USER-GATED to a product change.** P-013 tried to build
  a taste-driven governed-winner flip fixture and could NOT: the builder brute-forced
  all 3 fixtures × 4 intents with a narrower-taste `ProjectMemory` and found NO
  governed-winner flip anywhere. **This is a POSITIVE alignment confirmation, not a
  gap** — reviewer-verified in source: `_apply_taste` (governance.py) moves only the
  `taste_triangle` **identity** axis (clamped ±`TASTE_MAX_DELTA 15`), maps only to
  `width_bloom`/`drum_room_bloom` (`_TASTE_KIND_BIAS`), and the governed winner is
  ranked on `overall_score` behind an **align-veto**, so **taste structurally cannot
  reorder a truth-ranked winner** (doctrine: "taste can never outrank a truth move,"
  working as intended). The unit "flip" in `test_governance_taste.py` only works
  because it hand-injects branch values curated scoring never produces. **The
  reachable end-to-end taste claim (taste reaches governance + down-weights identity
  with bounded evidence) is ALREADY proven on real data** by
  `tests/test_live_wire.py::test_taste_axis_changes_governance`. Making a real
  governed-winner flip reachable would need a product-code aesthetic change →
  **user-gated, a separate packet** (distinct from the reachable near-tie-creative
  FLIP fixture above).
- **Wider `--memory-dir` CLI surface (from P-009 reviewer — non-blocking; partly a
  product question):** consider whether more analyze-class CLI commands (beyond
  `cowork`) should accept `--memory-dir`. P-009 wired exactly one prod surface
  (`cowork.py:28`); the other 13 `analyze()` CLI call sites stay memoryless by
  design. Evaluate which, if any, warrant the live wire.
- **Low-priority test cleanup (from P-008):** `test_evidence_only_on_moved_candidates`
  in `tests/test_next_pass_history.py` has a redundant always-true inner guard;
  tidy when convenient. **Not its own packet** — fold into any future touch of
  that file.
- **Net-new event-logging packets (from P-002/P-004) — REFRAMED, still BLOCKED ON
  A PRODUCT DECISION:** `taste_feedback`, `validation_check`, `revert`,
  `manual_note` remain valid `EVENT_TYPES` members with **NO producer wired into
  the decision ledger today** (taste → `taste_calibration.json`; validation only
  returns; revert is a pass-record field; no `manual_note` writer exists).
  **Reframe (strengthened by P-009):** the recorded-signal loop now has TWO real
  downstream consumers **that are live in production** (P-007 recorded taste →
  governance and P-008 recorded history → next-pass, both wired through
  `analyze()` by P-009), so wiring `validation_check` / `taste_feedback` producers
  is **more justified than ever**. BUT this is still **net-new FEATURE work**
  behind the same unanswered product decision: **should validation / taste / revert
  / note signals actually be written to the decision ledger?** Keep deferred; do
  NOT start as packets until that product decision lands.
  **★ CORRECTION (P-018 finding — read before routing any such producer):** the
  decision LEDGER (`add_decision` → `decision_ledger.json`) has **ZERO analyze-path
  consumers** — `mem.ledger()` is display-only (`cli.py:315`). So a producer that
  merely WRITES to the ledger is **INERT** (the hollow trap). `validation_check` /
  `manual_note` producers now **need a NEW consumer — not just a ledger write.**
  The only LIVE learning channels are HISTORY (`mix_pass_history.json` →
  `_apply_history`) and TASTE (`taste_profile.json` → governance); P-018's
  confirmed `revert` correctly landed on the history channel (not the ledger).
- **★ Outcome-enum generalization (reviewer's P-018 trajectory note — non-blocking;
  a candidate, NOT staged):** capturing only `revert` leaves the outcome vocabulary
  lopsided. A future generalization to a small outcome enum
  (`reverted` / `kept` / `refined`) would round out the outcome→learning loop, and
  the P-018 `reverted: bool` field can widen to that later **WITHOUT breaking the
  byte-identical default.** Reachable, user-gated for the semantics; do NOT open
  without an explicit ask.
- **★ THE LEDGER-IS-DEAD FINDING (P-018 — a standing routing guard; now EXECUTABLY
  PINNED by P-021):** the decision LEDGER (`add_decision`/`decision_ledger`) has NO
  decision-making consumer — it is display-only (`cli.py:315`). **Do NOT route an
  inert ledger producer.** A confirmed-outcome / event producer is only real if it
  lands on a LIVE channel (history `mix_pass_history.json` → `_apply_history`, or
  taste `taste_profile.json` → governance). This is why P-018's confirmed revert
  lands on the history axis. **P-021 now pins this executably:** its live-vs-dead
  test proves `write_mix_decision` (dead ledger) does NOT change `suggest_next_pass`
  while `record_mix_pass` (live history) does — the guard is no longer a note-only,
  it is a green test.

## Genuinely real carried follow-ups (verified)

- **Real macOS/Logic test surface** — out of current authority (needs real DAW;
  blocked by the no-real-DAW guardrail).
- **Controlled Class-3 apply path** — guardrail-gated; do not open without an
  explicit apply-safety packet.

## Re-ranked strategic candidates (creative-scoring decision now resolved)

> coherence axis is open (P-010), the album-means truth is single-sourced (P-011),

> #13; P-015 decisive; P-016 reward, MERGED PR #15), and the judgment layer is now
> at a DOCTRINE-HONEST EQUILIBRIUM (P-017 — no honest further flip in the current

> the cowork surface (P-019 — read/write symmetric) and self-describing as an
> ordered, phase-grouped session flow (P-020 — `describe_session`, 34 commands;
> steps 1 & 2 of the arc P-019→P-023 to a Cowork-usable end-to-end state). For
> orchestrator re-survey:

- **THE FLIP PROGRAM IS ESSENTIALLY COMPLETE — DOCTRINE-HONEST EQUILIBRIUM
  (P-017).** The three levers have converged: penalty (P-012/P-015), reward
  (P-016), and base-value re-curation (P-017) all confirm `subtractive_drop`'s
  dominance is legitimate; the masked-vocal and foregrounded-loop overrides are the
  only warranted flips; **NO honest further flip exists in the current dimension
  set.** The reward-family (further rows) and re-curation-for-flips threads are
  CLOSED as saturated. **The ONE remaining honest thread — user-gated, NOT staged:**
  a SYMMETRIC re-judgment — is `subtractive_drop` at 85.29 (high on every dim)
  itself slightly OVER-valued? Lowering it (rather than inflating a rival) would be
  a different, un-signed-off packet. Surface to the user; do NOT open without an
  explicit ask.
- **★ THE OUTCOME→LEARNING AXIS IS OPEN (P-018) AND NOW CLOSEABLE INSIDE COWORK
  (P-019).** P-018 landed the first confirmed-outcome signal (`memory-record
  --reverted` overrides the score-inference and measurably changes real
  `analyze(--memory-dir)` next_pass; opt-in / byte-identical default). **P-019
  brought the RECORD side onto the cowork surface** — a `record_mix_pass` command
  (registry 32→33) records a pass on the LIVE history channel, so an agent can close
  the loop (record → see `suggest_next_pass` change) without leaving the surface
  (read/write symmetric). The reachable outcome-side next move is the **outcome-enum
  generalization** (`reverted`/`kept`/`refined`, widening the `reverted: bool`
  without breaking the default) — **user-gated for the semantics; NOT staged.** The
  in-flight roadmap now is the cowork ARC — **P-020 (`describe_session`,
  self-describing session flow) is DONE (step 2); the remainder is P-021→P-023**
  (see the Deferred section). **Standing routing guard:** route any outcome/event
  producer onto a LIVE channel (history or taste), never the display-only ledger —
  and P-020 carries a P-021 nudge to SURFACE that live-vs-dead distinction in the
  walkthrough.
- **Option-B-visibility / decisiveness** — the CREATIVE half is fully closed:
  **P-013** proved the nudge fires on real data through `analyze()` (option-(a)
  no-flip on a clear ranking), **P-014** proved a near-tie FLIP was unreachable
  *under the then-current curation*, and **P-015** (user-signed-off product change)
  made it decisive on the masked-vocal near-tie (`vocal_belief`: vocal_ride →
  intimacy_pass, within the cap). Nothing reachable remains here. The TASTE-flip
  half is **user-gated** (needs a product change; the reachable taste claim is already
  covered by `test_live_wire.py::test_taste_axis_changes_governance`).
- Wider `--memory-dir` surface remains a small in-authority move (partly product).
- Net-new **event-logging** producers remain behind the product decision.

## Done (resolved)

- **★★ P-032a DONE — the SECOND new producer-agnostic doctrine axis
  `negative_space` (absolute arrangement room/sparsity) lands byte-identically for
  halee_ramone; the Timbaland sub-arc continues past the crux**
  (`build-os/receipts/P-032a-negative-space.md`). New agnostic scorer
  `_negative_space(records, sections, mix_metrics, doctrine)` in
  `doctrine_engine.py` composes ABSOLUTE arrangement room/sparsity as a STRENGTH
  from section-aggregate physics — low mean section spectral `density` (room), a
  genuine dropout section (`min_section_density` / min RMS meaningfully below max —
  "silence as arrangement"), and transient breathing room (low mean section
  `transient_density`) — always returning a clamped float (neutral fallback 40.0).
  Deliberately DISTINCT from `_dynamic_mix` (section-to-section movement): a
  dense-but-moving case scores `dynamic_mix = 100.0` vs `negative_space = 15.0`
  (85-pt gap), guarded by an explicit distinctness test. Wired into `score_doctrine`
  as `negative_space_score` appended LAST to `component_scores` (after
  `beat_identity_score`, summation order preserved → overall bit-identical) with
  `weights["negative_space_score"] = 0` in `halee_ramone.json` + a
  `doctrine.scorers.negative_space` constants block; `producer_profile._validate`
  now requires `negative_space`; `doctrine_score.schema.json` documents the optional
  `negative_space_score`. Constants: `neutral 40.0 / baseline 15.0 /
  density_ceiling 1.0 / room_coeff 50 / transient_ceiling 1.0 / breathing_coeff 20 /
  dropout_coeff 25 / dropout_floor 0.1`; live fixture scores (weight-0,
  informational) 62.3 / 15.0 / 20.0. **Byte-identical PROVEN** (0 mismatches / 27
  comparisons vs set-active base `836bd22`, overalls 73.8 / 70.7 / 74.3 unchanged;
  regression 68/68, 0 critical, 0 warnings UNCHANGED). **Liveness LOAD-BEARING** (a
  non-zero weight moves `analyze()` overall; sabotage fails liveness — drop
  threading → FAIL/KeyError, hardcode → 8 fail + 5 err — while byte-identical stays
  green; the P-016/P-029 lesson) + value-discrimination (incl. distinctness from
  dynamic_mix). **Honest boundary documented in-code, NOT faked:** sample-level
  inter-onset silence gaps need onset timing not visible at `score_doctrine` time
  (→ P-032b groove live-wire); section-aggregate grain only. No-aliasing (scorer
  only reads `doctrine[...]`, no-aliasing test). Single commit `3edcd9c` (green in
  isolation = 413 — HEAD IS Commit-1); suite 396 → 413 (+17; 0
  failed/skipped/warnings, green under `-W error`); 3 doctrine-key pins updated
  (`test_producer_profile.py` scorers-set, `test_doctrine_profile_sourced.py`
  `_WEIGHTS` value-pin, `test_beat_identity.py` beat_identity now index 7). Safety
  grep clean; honest-scope confirmed; UI N/A. qa **GREEN**; reviewer **PASS** (all 8
  scrutiny points; byte-identical empirically proven base→HEAD; distinctness
  non-tautological; honesty gate genuine; liveness load-bearing; agnostic-first
  (all 8 tunables in the profile); no-aliasing; guard updates legitimate
  tightening; Product Trajectory Check pass; no must-fix). **Codex NOT available —
  single-reviewer verdict.** **★★ MILESTONE — the engine now carries 9 component
  axes; the producer-agnostic architecture (P-029) continues to prove EXTENSIBLE.**
  **P-032a local-only** (`3edcd9c` on the dev branch atop the `6d34c30` P-029-close
  base), not pushed/merged. Non-blocking reviewer note carried to Deferred: the two
  `liveness` docstrings in `test_negative_space.py` (and the same in
  `test_beat_identity.py`) overclaim — cosmetic, fold a one-line fix into a future
  doctrine touch. Recommended next: **P-032b (groove_coherence live-wire)**.

- **★★ P-032e DONE — the FIRST new producer-agnostic doctrine axis `beat_identity`
  (strength-form) lands byte-identically for halee_ramone; the Timbaland sub-arc is
  underway with the crux front-loaded**
  (`build-os/receipts/P-032e-beat-identity.md`). New agnostic scorer
  `_beat_identity(records, events, doctrine)` in `doctrine_engine.py` measures the
  STRENGTH of a central rhythmic fingerprint from transient physics alone (candidacy
  by `transient_density`, NOT instrument label; presence vs a `no_beat` floor;
  distinctness above the track median; definition via `crest_factor_db`;
  foreground/unmasked bonus, buried/masked penalty). Wired into `score_doctrine` as
  `beat_identity_score` appended LAST to `component_scores` (7-term summation order
  preserved → overall bit-identical) with `weights["beat_identity_score"] = 0` in
  `halee_ramone.json` + a `doctrine.scorers.beat_identity` constants block;
  `producer_profile._validate` now requires the `beat_identity` scorer group;
  `doctrine_score.schema.json` documents the optional `beat_identity_score`. Constants:
  `no_beat 20.0 / transient_floor 0.35 / baseline 50.0 / dominance_coeff 40 /
  definition_crest_db 12.0 / definition_bonus 12 / foreground_bonus 18 /
  buried_penalty 14 / masked_penalty 12`; live fixture scores (weight-0,
  informational) 89.1 / 52.7 / 46.0. **Byte-identical PROVEN** (0/24 mismatches vs
  clean base `6d34c30`, overalls 73.8 / 70.7 / 74.3 unchanged; regression 68/68, 0
  critical, 0 warnings UNCHANGED). **Liveness LOAD-BEARING** (a non-zero weight moves
  `analyze()` overall + direction tracks the beat score; sabotage fails liveness
  while byte-identical stays green — the P-016/P-029 lesson) + value-discrimination
  (punchy/foregrounded/distinct → HIGH; none → `no_beat` floor). **Honest boundaries
  documented in-code, NOT faked:** fingerprint TYPING, onset REGULARITY/IOI (→ P-032b
  groove live-wire), and "more undeniable after a move" (before/after render) are OUT
  OF SCOPE. No-aliasing (scorer only reads `doctrine[...]`, two no-aliasing tests).
  Two commits `8239f42` (green in isolation = 396) + `9d6764e`; suite 384 → 396
  (+12; 0 failed/skipped/warnings, green under `-W error`). Safety grep clean;
  honest-scope confirmed; UI N/A. qa **GREEN**; reviewer **PASS** (all 7 scrutiny
  points; byte-identical numerically proven over 100k trials; liveness load-bearing
  by an in-memory sabotage; guard updates legitimate tightening; no must-fix). **Codex
  NOT available — single-model review.** **★★ MILESTONE — the producer-agnostic
  architecture (P-029) is proven EXTENSIBLE, not just parameterizable.** **P-032e
  local-only** (`8239f42`, `9d6764e` on the dev branch on top of the `6d34c30`
  P-029-close base), not pushed/merged. Recommended next: **P-032a (negative_space)**.

- **★★ P-029 DONE — THE PIVOT: the producer profile is now a LIVE, SELECTABLE LEVER
  end-to-end; `analyze(producer=…)` SELECTS which profile drives the judgment**
  (`build-os/receipts/P-029-parameterize-pipeline-by-per-call-producer-profile.md`).
  `pipeline.analyze(..., producer: str | ProducerProfile = "halee_ramone")` accepts a
  NAME or a ready `ProducerProfile` (isinstance dispatch), loads ONCE per call, and
  threads `profile=` to `score_doctrine` / `run_creative_engine` / `run_governance`,
  which thread it to ALL leaf scorers (doctrine's 7 scorers + weights; creative's
  `score_variant`/`_apply_nudges`/`_apply_promotions`; governance's
  `govern_branches`/`govern_variant`/`taste_triangle`/`_apply_taste`) — each reads its
  producer-specific values from the PASSED profile, defaulting to the module
  `_DEFAULT_PROFILE` when `profile is None`. **KILL_SWITCHES recomposed per call = 5
  hardcoded producer-AGNOSTIC SAFETY switches + the profile's aesthetic switches** (a
  swapped producer can NEVER drop a safety guarantee; default composed list
  byte-identical, no safety string in JSON). **No judgment VALUE changed;
  physics/analyzers untouched.** **Byte-identical default PROVEN** (reviewer
  independently byte-diffed default doctrine+creative+governance pre-P-029 vs HEAD
  across all 3 fixtures → IDENTICAL; no-arg == `producer="halee_ramone"` == reference
  object; regression **68/68, 0 critical, 0 warnings — UNCHANGED**). **Selection
  GENUINELY LIVE across all 3 layers** through the REAL analyze() path (synthetic
  one-value-mutated profiles, no monkeypatch): doctrine `baselines.halee` −20 →
  `halee_score` delta exactly 20; creative boosted `vocal_ride` kind_score → variant
  `overall_score` → 100; governance `truth_alignment["intimate"]["vocal_ride"]` 88→60
  → governed `emotional_truth_alignment` 60. **LOAD-BEARING PROVEN BOTH WAYS (the
  P-016 lesson):** sabotaging each layer's threading fails ITS liveness test while
  byte-identical/determinism stay green. **Reviewer grep: ZERO module-global
  producer-value reads inside any scorer body on the hot path — no leaf missed.** Two
  commits `42d6ebd` (doctrine + creative + pipeline wiring + byte-identical +
  doctrine/creative liveness — green in isolation = 383) + `ea1aaa9` (governance
  threading + governance liveness). Suite **370 → 384 passed** (+14; 0
  failed/skipped/warnings, green under `-W error`). Scope: exactly 5 files (4 product +
  1 new test); existing tests UNEDITED; physics/analyzers/bridge/planners untouched.
  Safety grep clean; UI N/A. qa **GREEN**; reviewer **pass**. **Codex NOT available —
  single-reviewer verdict.** **★★ MILESTONE — THE PIVOT: the producer-agnostic
  ARCHITECTURE is COMPLETE and VALIDATED** (reference-profile-driven judgment + a
  producer-AGNOSTIC physics/safety chassis + per-call producer selection). **★
  CARRY-FORWARD for P-032:** the `_DEFAULT_PROFILE` singleton STILL exists as the
  `None`-default fallback in all 3 modules — keep the aliasing discipline when a
  second live profile is loaded. **P-029 local-only** (`42d6ebd`, `ea1aaa9` on the dev
  branch on top of the `e79426a` base), not pushed/merged.

- **★★ P-028 DONE — doctrine sourced from the reference profile, WIDENED (the LAST
  & LARGEST extraction); THE EXTRACTION PHASE IS COMPLETE**
  (`build-os/receipts/P-028-doctrine-sources-values-from-reference-profile.md`).
  `doctrine_engine.py` gains `_DEFAULT_PROFILE = load_profile("halee_ramone")`; all 8
  scorers now read their aesthetic constants from the profile — **Part A** the
  P-025-captured `weights` (halee 1.0 / ramone 1.2 / vocal_centrality 1.2 / depth 1.0 /
  contrast 1.0 / static 1.0 / dynamic 0.8) + `_halee`/`_ramone` baselines (86.0) +
  penalty coeffs; **Part B WIDENED** the profile with a new `doctrine.scorers` group (5
  function groups: `_vocal_centrality` / `_depth_hierarchy` / `_section_contrast` /
  `_static_mix` / `_dynamic_mix`), each constant captured VERBATIM, then sourced. **The
  PHYSICS/measurement code (fg_frac, band max, pstdev, distinct counting, section
  detection) + the presentation thresholds (`stereo_width > 0.6`, `distinct <= 1`,
  `score < 55`) STAY hardcoded — producer-AGNOSTIC.** Clean literal→`c["…"]`
  substitution; formula shape/order preserved; int/float types match. **Byte-identical:**

  producer-specific judgment layer (creative P-026 + governance P-027 + doctrine P-028)
  is now sourced from the reference `ProducerProfile`, BYTE-IDENTICAL, with the physics
  chassis + safety kill-switches cleanly separated and left hardcoded; **the reference
  profile FULLY DRIVES the judgment layer.** Finding A FULLY RESOLVED; aliasing-proof
  DISCHARGED for all 3 modules. **★ Reviewer observation (carry into P-029):** the
  measurement-vs-aesthetic thresholds (`stereo_width > 0.6`, `distinct <= 1`,
  `score < 55`) are correctly left hardcoded as physics/presentation, NOT producer taste
  — keep them OUT of the profile when P-029 threads the profile per-call. **P-028 is
  local-only** (commits `29b9dfe`, `72e98a7` on the dev branch on top of the P-027
  commits on top of the `e79426a` base), not pushed/merged at close.

- **★ P-025 DONE — the FOUNDATION of the producer-agnostic epic: today's
  hardcoded Halee/Ramone judgment is now a frozen, round-trip-guarded, UNWIRED
  `ProducerProfile`** (`build-os/receipts/P-025-producer-profile-schema-loader-halee-ramone-extraction.md`).
  `logic_mix_os/doctrine/producer_profile.py` (frozen dataclass + pure
  `load_profile()`) + `doctrine/producers/halee_ramone.json` (VERBATIM reference +
  honesty metadata stamp). Byte-identical round-trip guard (exact for clean
  constants incl. `KILL_SWITCHES[5:9]` with safety items 1–5 correctly EXCLUDED;
  indirect + non-vacuous for the inline-computed doctrine weights / 86.0 baselines
  / penalty_coeffs / default_creative_mode). The four judgment sources
  byte-unchanged; nothing consumes the profile; regression 68/68 UNCHANGED. Two
  commits `195127c` + `e6cb038`; suite 293 → 319 (+26). qa GREEN; reviewer pass
  (hand-verified every value byte-accurate); Codex unavailable (single-reviewer).

- **★★ THE MILESTONE — P-021 PROVES THE COWORK SURFACE IS AGENT-DRIVABLE
  END-TO-END; the canonical target is essentially MET at the decision-system level
  (THIRD step of the arc P-019→P-023) — DONE via P-021**
  (`build-os/receipts/P-021-verified-end-to-end-cowork-walkthrough.md`).
  **TESTS-ONLY — no product/runtime change; drives the already-built surface.**
  A full plan-only mixing session drives end-to-end THROUGH the cowork surface only
  (`build_context` + `run_command`), in `describe_session`'s canonical order, and
  the learning loop CLOSES within the surface. No honesty-clause gap found — every
  phase's essential command was reachable and the loop closed across the full
  session. **The driven spine (8 phases, via `run_command`, NOT bypassing to
  `analyze()`/`record_pass`):** intake→`intake_project`, classify→`classify_tracks`,

  checklist→`render_logic_checklist`, validate→`validate_mix_pass`,
  record-outcome→`record_mix_pass` (LIVE), next-pass→`suggest_next_pass` (each
  JSON-serializable + shape-asserted). **The loop CLOSES (milestone assertion,
  load-bearing + non-tautological):** `record_mix_pass(..., reverted=True)` on the
  LIVE channel → a FRESH `build_context(memory_dir=...)` → `suggest_next_pass`
  surfaces the confirmed "Revert last pass" (evidence contains "confirm"), NO hand
  re-run. **Proven load-bearing** (qa AND reviewer independently — dropping
  `reverted`/routing off the live channel → the assertion FAILS; reviewer via
  monkeypatch) and **non-tautological** (the identical score-IMPROVED sequence with
  `reverted=False` surfaces NO revert). **Live-vs-dead pinned as an EXECUTABLE fact
  (resolves the carried P-020 clarity nudge):** `write_mix_decision` (DEAD ledger —
  writes only `decision_ledger.json`, runtime-verified) does NOT change next-pass;
  `record_mix_pass` (LIVE history) does — only `record_mix_pass` closes the loop.
  **Honest skips (none an essential linear phase):** `compare_to_reference` (needs a
  reference bounce → `{"note": "no reference supplied"}`), `override_track_identity`
  (param-heavy/mutating), `build_missing_tool`/`run_creative_engine`/
  `describe_session` (auxiliary/off-axis). **PRECISION (do NOT overstate):** the
  coverage-honesty test (`test_walkthrough_covers_the_registry_honestly`) guards
  PHASE-COMPLETENESS (every `describe_session` phase has a driven essential command
  belonging to that phase) + test-1's exact 8-phase order pin — it does NOT assert a
  full `driven ∪ skipped == 34` registry partition (it references 13 of 34). The full
  34-command exact-cover partition is guarded SEPARATELY by P-020's
  `tests/test_cowork_session_flow.py` (31 phases + 3 auxiliary = 34); together the two
  files tell the truth about registry coverage. **Single commit `dce156b`**

- **`describe_session` makes the cowork surface self-describing as an ordered,
  phase-grouped session flow (SECOND step of the arc P-019→P-023) — DONE via P-020**
  (`build-os/receipts/P-020-describe-session-flow-discoverability.md`). **PRODUCT-code
  feature; in-authority, additive, read-only (a grouping OVER the existing registry —
  no new product decision).** Adds a pure `_SESSION_FLOW` structure + a read-only
  `describe_session` command to the cowork `COMMANDS` registry (count **33 → 34**)
  that returns the SAME registry as `{"phases": [...ordered...], "auxiliary": [...]}`
  in the canonical order **intake → classify → diagnose → plan → checklist → validate
  → record-outcome → next-pass** (grounded in the README pipeline + the P-018/P-019
  record/validate steps). **31 commands** map onto the 8 linear phases; **3 are
  honestly `auxiliary`** — OFF the linear axis: `run_creative_engine` (parallel
  creative exploration), `build_missing_tool` (meta tooling-gap helper),
  `describe_session` (self-describing). **Honesty clause honored:** no fabricated
  flow; `suggest_next_pass` placed ONCE (in `next-pass`), not double-listed.
  **Completeness INVARIANT (the load-bearing guard):** every `COMMANDS` key appears
  EXACTLY ONCE across phases + auxiliary (exact cover — no orphan, no duplicate),
  keeping the flow honest as commands are added; proven load-bearing (orphan or
  duplicate → the invariant test FAILS), independently verified by qa
  (**31 + 3 = 34 = len(COMMANDS)**). **Additive / read-only:** `list_commands` /
  `run_command` / every existing handler are BYTE-UNCHANGED; `describe_session` is
  deterministic (byte-identical across calls) and DEEP-COPIES its output so callers
  can't mutate the module-level `_SESSION_FLOW`. **Single commit `942a68a`** (purely
  additive `cowork.py` +100, new `tests/test_cowork_session_flow.py` 10 tests, the
  one intended `test_cowork.py` count assertion 33→34; single commit = tip, green in
  isolation = 269). **Proof:** suite **259 → 269 passed** (+10; 0
  failed/skipped/warnings, green under `-W error`); regression **68/68, 0 critical,
  0 warnings** held (additive read-only → goldens untouched); registry 34, no stale
  33 anywhere; safety grep clean; UI N/A; existing cowork + P-008/P-009/P-018/P-019
  tests green. qa **GREEN** (independent exact-partition verification 31+3=34).
  Reviewer **pass** — verified EVERY command placement against its real handler; the
  flow is truthful (two defensible judgment calls: `score_mix` and
  `compare_to_reference` placed in `plan`); the 3 auxiliaries are genuinely off-axis;
  the invariant is load-bearing. **Codex NOT available — single-reviewer verdict.**
  **Reviewer non-blocking flag → carried to P-021:** `write_mix_decision` (dead
  ledger) and `record_mix_pass` (live history) both sit under `record-outcome`, but
  the dead/live distinction is NOT surfaced in `describe_session`'s output — add a
  one-line clarity nudge in the P-021 walkthrough (see the Deferred section above).

- **`record_mix_pass` closes the learning loop INSIDE the cowork surface (FIRST
  step of the arc P-019→P-023 to a Cowork-usable end-to-end state) — DONE via
  P-019** (`build-os/receipts/P-019-record-mix-pass-closes-loop-in-cowork.md`).
  **PRODUCT-code feature; in-authority (reuses the already-live
  `record_pass`/`_apply_history` channel — no new product decision).** Adds a
  **`record_mix_pass`** command to the cowork `COMMANDS` registry (count **32 →
  33**). **The mechanism:** its handler (`cowork.py:97-106`) records a pass on the
  LIVE history channel — `ctx["memory"].record_pass(name, ctx["result"],
  reverted=...)` → `mix_pass_history.json` — passing through the P-018 `reverted`
  ground-truth flag (opt-in, default False), returning the record JSON; clean
  `{"error": "no memory_dir configured"}` when no memory dir (mirrors
  `_write_mix_decision`). So an agent driving through the cowork surface can now
  RECORD an outcome and see `suggest_next_pass` change WITHOUT leaving the surface —
  the read/write cowork surface is symmetric (the READ side was already live via
  P-009). Routes to the LIVE channel, NOT the dead decision ledger. **One surface
  finding, resolved minimally (NOT a wall):** the cowork `--params '{...}'` path
  unpacks user JSON into `run_command(name, ctx, **params)`, so a handler param
  named `name` collided with the dispatcher's positional `name`; fixed by making
  the dispatcher's `name`/`ctx` **positional-only** (`run_command(name, ctx, /,
  **params)`) — behavior-preserving (repo-wide grep found ZERO callers passing
  `name=`/`ctx=` by keyword; the sole product caller `cli.py:237` passes
  positionally). **Two commits (≤2):** `b7572b7` Commit-1 (handler + registry row +
  positional-only + unit tests; test-first, green in isolation = 257) + `de5679f`
  Commit-2 (no-re-run liveness guard). `cowork.py` is the only product file touched.
  **Proof:** suite **253 → 259 passed** (+6; 0 failed/skipped/warnings, green under
  `-W error`); regression **68/68, 0 critical, 0 warnings** held (opt-in memory path
  → goldens untouched; byte-identical default). **LIVENESS proven load-bearing (the
  P-016/P-018 lesson honored):** `test_loop_closes_through_cowork_no_rerun` records
  a confirmed revert via `run_command("record_mix_pass", ...)` on a score-IMPROVED
  override case, then a FRESH `build_context(memory_dir=...)` →
  `run_command("suggest_next_pass")` surfaces the confirmed "Revert last pass" — NO
  hand re-run. Both qa and reviewer INDEPENDENTLY broke the wiring (handler off the
  live channel) → FAILS; restored → PASSES. **Routes to the live channel (runtime
  probe):** only `mix_pass_history.json` created, never `decision_ledger.json`.
  **Byte-identical default:** date-neutralised canonical JSON equal to standalone
  `memory-record`. Registry 33, no stale 32. Scope: only 3 files (`cowork.py`

- **Confirmed-revert outcome feeds the live next-pass loop (the FIRST
  confirmed-outcome signal in the learning loop) — DONE via P-018**
  (`build-os/receipts/P-018-confirmed-revert-feeds-next-pass-loop.md`).
  **PRODUCT-code feature; a PIVOT off the complete judgment-tuning path onto the
  learning-loop / feedback frontier** (user said "Yes"); orchestrator-routed;
  **OVERRIDE semantics chosen by the orchestrator-in-chief (user may redirect at
  the merge gate).** Until now every loop signal was score-INFERRED; P-018 adds a
  CONFIRMED one. **The mechanism:** an opt-in `memory-record --reverted` records a
  confirmed operator revert on a pass (`record_pass(..., reverted=True)` →
  `mix_pass_history.json`); the live `_apply_history` consumer (already threaded to
  real `analyze(--memory-dir)` via P-009) then, on a confirmed revert, DEMOTES the
  recommended-then-reverted moves and surfaces exactly ONE confirmed "Revert last
  pass" item at priority 95 — **regardless of the score-delta `got_worse`
  inference (OVERRIDE)**, with an early return that prevents double-up with the
  score-inferred revert candidate; distinct honest evidence line (contains
  "confirm", vs the score-inferred "recorded revert candidate(s): …").
  **OVERRIDE rationale:** a confirmed operator revert is GROUND TRUTH and outranks
  the heuristic proxy (Halee/Ramone operator-serving judgment). **Why THIS seam:**
  the decision LEDGER (`add_decision` → `decision_ledger.json`) has ZERO
  analyze-path consumers (display-only, `cli.py:315`), so any reserved-ledger-event
  producer would be INERT; the ONLY reachable LIVE seam was the history axis
  (`record_pass` → `_apply_history`) — hence the confirmed revert lands there.
  **Two commits (≤2):** `736fa8b` Commit-1 (`record_pass` `reverted` field +
  `_apply_history` override + 9 unit tests; test-first, green in isolation = 249) +
  `6134d27` Commit-2 (`--reverted` CLI wire + 4 no-re-run liveness/CLI tests).
  `memory.py`, `planners/next_pass_planner.py`, `cli.py` are the only product files
  touched. **Proof:** suite **240 → 253 passed** (+13; 0 failed/skipped/warnings,
  green under `-W error`); regression **68/68, 0 critical, 0 warnings** held (no
  `memory_dir` → falsy no-op → goldens untouched). **LIVENESS proven load-bearing
  (the P-016 lesson honored):** the no-re-run liveness test asserts on real
  `analyze(memory_dir=...)` `next_pass` and FAILS with the pre-P-018
  `_apply_history` (would be inert) and PASSES at tip — NOT inert. **OVERRIDE
  non-vacuous:** with an IMPROVED score delta (`got_worse` empty) but
  `reverted=True`, the confirmed "Revert last pass" still surfaces at rank 0 and
  the reverted move is demoted — override, not a score echo. **Byte-identical
  default:** no `--reverted` → next_pass identical to today; no `reverted` key when
  unused. **Scope clean:** ledger/`add_decision`/reserved ledger events, taste axis,
  `_KIND_SCORES`/creative/governance UNTOUCHED; P-008 `test_next_pass_history.py` +
  P-009 `test_live_wire.py` unedited and green (17). Safety grep clean; UI N/A. qa
  **GREEN** (independently mutation-verified liveness + non-vacuous override; qa
  self-flagged a transient stale-state artifact in one of its OWN scratch scripts —
  a qa-harness quirk, NOT a product defect — and confirmed the traced re-runs are
  authoritative). Reviewer **pass** (override bounded/deterministic; early-return
  skips only the score-inferred revert; demotes exactly the reverted pass's
  recommended moves; mutation-verified load-bearing). **Codex NOT available —
  single-reviewer verdict.** **Reviewer trajectory note (non-blocking, candidate,
  NOT staged):** a future outcome enum (`reverted`/`kept`/`refined`) would round
  out the loop — the `reverted: bool` field can widen to it WITHOUT breaking the
  byte-identical default. **P-018 is local-only** (commits `736fa8b`, `6134d27` on

- **Base-value `_KIND_SCORES` re-curation (density → depth_cleanup) — RESOLVED as
  a VERIFIED NEGATIVE FINDING via P-017**
  (`build-os/receipts/P-017-doctrine-honest-kind-scores-recuration.md`).
  **User-signed-off ("A"); the FIRST attempt to change a base `_KIND_SCORES`
  value** (crossing the line P-012/P-015/P-016 held: they layered evidence nudges
  on an UNTOUCHED base). **FINDING: an honest re-curation of `depth_cleanup` CANNOT
  flip the `density` branch — arithmetically forced by the DOCTRINE (which dims are
  honestly movable), not a search failure. `_KIND_SCORES` LEFT UNTOUCHED — NO
  product change** (the honesty clause held; P-014 discipline). **The forced
  arithmetic:** `overall = mean(7 dims) − risk_penalty`; `depth_cleanup` 81.14
  (dim sum 568) vs `subtractive_drop` 85.29 (dim sum 597, low risk) → gap 4.14; the
  only doctrine-defensible under-valuation is `contrast` (dc 72 vs sd 88): →88 =
  83.43 (short 1.86), →100 (impossible ceiling) = 85.14 (STILL below); a FULL honest
  re-curation (contrast→88, technical→85, ramone→86, taste→86; halee stays 90=max,
  vocal_belief stays 86; **excitement LOCKED at 66**) reaches only 83.86 (short
  1.43); the entire residual deficit lives in `excitement` (66 vs 78), OFF-LIMITS to
  inflate (subtle depth work is honestly un-flashy) — the only flips require
  inflating excitement or re-labeling a depth pass as vocal-forward, both dishonest.
  **The committed guard (load-bearing, non-tautological):** the builder committed
  ONLY `tests/test_density_recuration.py` (NEW, 12 tests, +183, sole packet commit
  `1b03ad3`) pinning the 5-branch winner table UNCHANGED on the real `analyze()`
  path + the honest-ceiling arithmetic + `_KIND_SCORES` untouched; an injected
  inflated `depth_cleanup` (contrast=88+excitement=90, or all dims=100) makes it
  FAIL (density → density_A), so it genuinely catches an accidental/dishonest
  density flip. Committing executable arithmetic is defensible here (unlike P-014's
  no-commit finding) because the finding IS arithmetic and the variant-scoring path
  is golden-unguarded. **Before/after winner table (all 5 branches, real path)
  UNCHANGED:** chorus_lift→subtractive_drop 85.3; density→subtractive_drop 85.3;
  loop→subtractive_drop 85.3 (default); depth→depth_cleanup 81.1 (single-variant);
  vocal_belief→vocal_ride 82.9. **Proof:** suite **228 → 240 passed** (+12; 0
  failed/skipped/warnings, green under `-W error`); regression **68/68, 0 critical,
  0 warnings** held; Commit-1 (the sole commit) green in isolation (new file alone
  12 passed); safety grep clean; UI N/A; P-012/P-013/P-015/P-016 test files NOT
  edited and pass (69). qa **GREEN — FINDING CONFIRMED**; reviewer **pass** (judged
  the finding doctrine-HONEST, not a masked search failure). **Codex NOT available
  — single-reviewer verdict.** **THE EQUILIBRIUM SYNTHESIS:** three levers converge
  — penalty (P-012/P-015, saturated: only vocal_belief gap 1.71<cap 2.0 flippable),
  reward (P-016, saturated at cap 4.0: only loop gap 3.43 reachable), base-value
  re-curation (P-017: density unflippable honestly) — **the judgment layer is at a
  DOCTRINE-HONEST EQUILIBRIUM; no honest further flip exists in the current
  dimension set.** The one open thread: is `subtractive_drop` itself over-valued? —
  a symmetric re-judgment, user-gated, un-signed-off, NOT staged. **P-017's guard

  **User-delegated PRODUCT-code change** (direction A "open the base-scoring
  decision space" + fork (i) "evidence-gated" + "keep skating"; the
  build-orchestrator routed). **This crosses the penalty-only line P-012/P-015
  held — the FIRST reward/promotion nudge.** **Two commits (≤2):**
  `b15b957` Commit-1 — `creative.py` (+88): `CREATIVE_PROMOTION_CAP = 4.0` (a
  SEPARATE constant from the ±2.0 penalty `CREATIVE_NUDGE_CAP`), a
  `_PROMOTION_TABLE` row (kind `loop_deconstruct`, evidence `foregrounded_loop`,
  `+35` excitement `= +5.0` raw clamped to exactly `+4.0`, verbatim reason), a
  `_foregrounded_loop` predicate reading the REAL wire (a `"foregrounded loop"`
  red_flag from `source_auditors` corroborated by `provenance` `high_risk`;
  getattr-defensive), and promotion application in `score_variant` (summed
  promotion overall-delta clamped to `+4.0`; `loop_promotion` reason appended to
  `score_nudges` on fire) + `tests/test_loop_promotion.py` (NEW, +233).
  **Green in isolation: 226 passed.** `a9f4e26` Commit-2 — the LIVE-WIRE:
  `pipeline.py` (+17/−3) relocates `analyze_provenance` + `audit_all` to just
  BEFORE `run_creative_engine` (a pure relocation — inputs already populated
  ~90 lines earlier) + two production-liveness tests (+70). **★ The P-009-style
  catch:** Commit-1's mechanism was INERT in production —
  `run_creative_engine` ran BEFORE `provenance`/`source_audits`, so the predicate
  always read empty evidence and the promotion NEVER fired in the real
  `analyze()` output; Commit-1's tests passed only because they RE-RAN the engine
  on the finished result. The orchestrator-in-chief caught it (the builder had
  mislabeled the ordering "by design"); Commit-2's live-wire fixed it, guarded by
  the two liveness tests that assert on the real `analyze()`
  `result.creative`/`result.governance` with NO re-run (FAIL pre-reorder, PASS
  after). **`_KIND_SCORES`, `CREATIVE_NUDGE_CAP`, the entire penalty table/path,
  and both existing predicates are byte-UNTOUCHED; `governance.py` has ZERO
  `provenance`/`source_audits` refs** → reorder SAFE BY CONSTRUCTION (backed
  by a 12-artifact byte-identical diff across all 3 seeded fixtures). **Behavior
  (qa-verified):** loop_deconstruct 81.9 → **85.9** (raw +5.0 clamped to
  exactly +4.0 = the cap binds, carries the `loop_promotion` line) >
  subtractive_drop 85.3 → **loop winner flips `loop_B` → `loop_A` by
  0.6** (governed winner also flips, no veto). **Load-bearing negative control:**
  no foregrounded-loop evidence → subtractive_drop wins (flip caused by the
  EVIDENCE). **Collateral:** ONLY the loop branch flips (chorus_lift/density still
  subtractive_drop — `subtractive_drop` now wins 2 branches, not 3, relieving
  anti_template; vocal_belief per P-015; depth unchanged); P-012/P-013/P-015 test
  files NOT edited and pass (58). **Proof:** suite **217 → 228 passed** (+11;
  0 failed/skipped/warnings, green under `-W error`); regression **68/68, 0
  critical, 0 warnings** (`loops_not_foregrounded` held); safety grep clean; UI
  N/A. **Reviewer pass** with a non-vacuity mutation check (emptying the promotion
  row → 5 promotion-dependent + 2 liveness tests RED, negative control GREEN;
  reverting ONLY the reorder → the 2 liveness tests RED) + a reward-creep
  watch-item; the `plan_depth` monkeypatch in the liveness test is a legitimate
  seam (real audit_all/analyze_provenance/run_creative_engine produce+consume the
  evidence, nothing faked). **Codex NOT available — single-reviewer

- **Make-the-nudge-decisive (masked-vocal near-tie) — DONE via P-015**
  (`build-os/receipts/P-015-decisive-masked-vocal-nudge.md`). **User-signed-off
  PRODUCT-code aesthetic change** (the user chose "Option 1 — Proceed, corrected",
  2026-06-30, after the orchestrator transparently corrected an arithmetic error —
  the old `−8` penalty only moves overall `−1.14`, insufficient to flip; the
  corrected mechanism strengthens to `−14`). The deliberate successor to P-012 and
  the resolution of the P-014 user-gated decision. **Single product commit
  `1756f61`** (product change + updated/new tests TOGETHER so Commit-1 is green in
  isolation, required because the change intentionally breaks old-behavior tests):
  `creative.py` `_NUDGE_TABLE` **row-0 only** — (1) exempt `intimacy_pass`
  (`kinds` `{width_bloom, vocal_ride, intimacy_pass}` → `{width_bloom,
  vocal_ride}` — an intimacy pass is the CORRECT response to a masked lead vocal,
  focused proximity not brute level/width), (2) strengthen `delta` `−8` → `−14`
  (`= −14/7 = −2.0` overall = EXACTLY `CREATIVE_NUDGE_CAP = 2.0`, unchanged, now
  binds `vocal_ride` too), plus an honest `−14` reason string, a doctrine comment,
  and a corrected stale clamp comment. `_KIND_SCORES`, the cap, row-1, the clamp,
  and both predicates are UNTOUCHED (verified by diff). **Behavior (qa-verified):**
  in the `vocal_belief` branch under a masked lead vocal, `vocal_ride` (vocal_A)
  82.9 → **80.9** (cap binds, overall_delta EXACTLY −2.0, carries the `−14`
  `score_nudges` line); `intimacy_pass` (vocal_B) 81.1 unchanged (exempt) →
  **winner FLIPS from vocal_ride to intimacy_pass** by 0.2. **Load-bearing negative
  control:** without `lead_masked`, vocal_ride wins (flip is caused by the masking
  evidence, not a base re-rank). **Bounded — no clear-ranking overturn:**
  `subtractive_drop` (85.3, penalty-immune) still wins `chorus_lift` / `density` /
  `loop` under `lead_masked` (gaps 3.4–4.2 ≫ 2×cap); ONLY the `vocal_belief`
  branch flips. **Tests (the binding guard — variant-scoring path golden-unguarded):**
  updated the ~existing P-012 cases in `tests/test_creative_nudges.py` (delta
  `−8`→`−14`, `intimacy_pass` now asserted EXEMPT, new reason, width_bloom worst
  case `−20` raw clamped to `−2.0`; added `test_intimacy_pass_exempt_from_lead_masked_nudge`
  + `test_vocal_ride_clamps_to_cap_under_lead_masked`) and ADDED
  `tests/test_decisive_nudge.py` (NEW, 8 tests: flip + load-bearing negative control
  + `test_only_vocal_belief_branch_flips_under_lead_masked` +
  `test_subtractive_drop_branch_does_not_flip_under_lead_masked`); no coverage

  failed/skipped/warnings; changed files alone = 53 — `test_creative_nudges.py` 45,
  `test_decisive_nudge.py` 8); regression **68/68, 0 critical, 0 warnings** (doctrine
  golden held); Commit-1 green in isolation; safety grep clean (only a no-DAW

  arithmetic and ran a **mutation test confirming non-vacuity** (reverted both
  product edits → 5 binding tests went RED, the negative control correctly stayed
  GREEN → tests are load-bearing); confirmed scope discipline, no-overturn,
  evidence-line honesty, coverage not weakened. **Codex NOT available —

  the current `_KIND_SCORES` / `_NUDGE_TABLE`. The builder wrote ZERO code
  (honesty clause honored); qa adversarially tried to REFUTE it with THREE
  independent harnesses (builder inline-math + qa real-`score_variant` driver +
  a saturated worst-case `masking_report` with every classification the analyzer
  emits) — **all 0 flips** — and re-derived the arithmetic from source.
  Structural proof: `overall = mean(7 dims) − risk_penalty{low0/med6/high14}`,
  recomputed exactly as `score_variant`; base leaders are `generate_variants`
  literals keyed on `problem['id']` (fixture-invariant across 4 record sets);
  the **universal leader `subtractive_drop` (85.29) is penalty-immune** (in no
  `_NUDGE_TABLE` row), so `chorus_lift` / `density` / `loop` cannot reorder, and
  the **one sub-cap near-tie branch `vocal_belief`** (`vocal_ride` 82.86 vs
  `intimacy_pass` 81.14, gap 1.71) has BOTH hit by the identical row-0
  `lead_masked −8`, preserving the gap. **Headline reframing:** the P-012 nudge
  is a TRANSPARENCY/EVIDENCE layer — it moves the displayed governed
  `overall_score` and emits `score_nudges` but **can never reorder any branch**;
  P-013's option-(a) "cannot overturn a ranking" holds UNIVERSALLY (sharper than
  the P-012 "cannot overturn a *clear* ranking" framing). **Not a defect** — the
  nudge stays honest/bounded/penalty-only/evidence-tagged; decisive-when-close is
  latent until a user-gated curation change (see Deferred). **Suite 207 passed
  UNCHANGED; regression 68/68 held.** Commit-1-in-isolation N/A; `creative.py`
  unchanged since P-012 (`0df436c`); working tree clean; safety grep N/A.
  qa verdict **GREEN — FINDING CONFIRMED**; **Codex not available — single-reviewer
  verdict.** HEAD `596174d` (P-014 active-packet confirmation only; no product
  change). The P-014 harnesses live in scratchpad (not committed).

- **P-012 nudge proven on real data through `analyze()` (creative visibility
  fixture)** — **DONE via P-013**
  (`build-os/receipts/P-013-nudge-visibility-fixture.md`). **Tests-only** — one new
  file `tests/test_creative_nudge_visibility.py` (+154 lines, 5 tests); NO product
  code touched. Lifts the P-012 creative evidence-nudge from the unit level to the
  **live `pipeline.analyze()` production path**: on `dense_chorus_with_loops` the
  live masking analyzer emits a real `width_crowding` event, so the row-2 nudge
  (`vocal_belief −6`) fires on the `chorus_lift` `width_bloom` variant with no
  contrivance — overall_score (the governed-rank value) 75.7→**74.9** (movement
  −0.857, inside the ±2.0 cap), yet the winner stays `chorus_lift_B` (base gap ~9.6
  > 2× the cap). Builder chose **option (a)** — the cap binds, the winner does NOT
  flip — the documented latent-but-armed posture, now proven end-to-end. **Closes
  the golden-unguarded gap** on the variant-scoring path. Single tests-only commit
  `172cfd0`; suite 202→**207**; regression **68/68** held; Commit-1 green in
  isolation; safety grep clean (only hit a no-DAW docstring). Reviewer **pass** —
  independent negative control (disarmed `_apply_nudges` → 3 of 5 tests fail, so the
  assertions are load-bearing), independently recomputed the numbers, confirmed the
  Fixture #2 re-scope sound; **Codex not available — single-reviewer verdict.**
  Fixture #2 (taste-flip through `analyze()`) re-scoped to a POSITIVE alignment
  finding (taste structurally cannot flip a governed winner on curated data — see
  Deferred). P-013 is the **first post-merge packet** (PR #13 merged at `0f4e7e9`).
- **PR #13 (P-001…P-012 + canonical-alignment audit) MERGED to default** — merge
  commit `0f4e7e9` on `claude/dreamy-turing-z0oxll`. The whole P-001…P-012 line
  (including the option-B creative-scoring change) plus the AUDIT-2026-06-29
  canonical-alignment audit (verdict ALIGNED) is now on the default branch. The dev
  branch `claude/logic-mix-os-hardening-12-7hbeh1` was freshly restarted on top of
  the merge for post-merge work (P-013 onward).

- **Deeper creative scoring (option B, penalty-only)** — **DONE via P-012**
  (`build-os/receipts/P-012-creative-scoring-nudge-layer.md`).
  **The standing OPEN USER DECISION is resolved.** A bounded, transparent, capped,
  penalty-only evidence-nudge layer sits ON TOP of the curated `_KIND_SCORES`
  (values UNCHANGED): pure `_apply_nudges`/`_NUDGE_TABLE`; `vocal_belief −8` on a
  masked lead vocal (`bad_masking`) across `width_bloom`/`vocal_ride`/`intimacy_pass`
  (generalizing the old `width_bloom`-only caution); `vocal_belief −6` on
  `width_crowding` for `width_bloom`; summed overall delta clamped to
  `±CREATIVE_NUDGE_CAP = 2.0`; `score_nudges: [reason]` emitted only on fire.
  Deliberately NOT byte-identical when a nudge fires, but cannot overturn a clear
  base ranking (cap 2.0 < 2.4–4.2 gaps). Single product commit `0df436c`;
  suite 159→**202** (43 new); regression **68/68** held (variant path
  golden-unguarded — unit tests are the binding guard); Commit-1 green in
  isolation; CAP BINDS EXACTLY (75.7→73.7); NO RECOMMENDATION FLIP on the 3
  fixtures. Reviewer **pass** (adversarially proven — forced −70 raw still clamps
  to base−2.0; layer-ON vs OFF confirms non-tautological no-flip; Codex not
  available). **Awaiting the user's sign-off at PR #13 merge.** Reward nudges
  (rows 3+4) deferred; near-tie visibility fixture deferred.
- **Album delta consolidation / mean-derivation consolidation (P-011 candidate)**
  — **DONE via P-011**
  (`build-os/receipts/P-011-album-delta-consolidation.md`).
  **The two-place album-means truth is killed — single-sourced in `album.py`.**
  `album.py::analyze_album` additively emits per-song `brightness_delta` /
  `lufs_delta` (from the means it already computes); `cli.py::_run_album` consumes
  them and the duplicate `statistics.mean` recompute block (and the now-unused
  `import statistics`) is removed. VALUE-IDENTITY proven exact (emitted deltas ==
  `song − statistics.mean(non-None)` for all 3 fixtures, 0 mismatches; the `album`
  report's `coherence_score` / `outliers` / `verdict` unchanged). Commit-1
  `effccd0`; suite 155→**159**; regression 68/68 held; Commit-1 green in isolation.
- **CLI advisory float rounding (cosmetic, from P-010 reviewer)** — **DONE via
  P-011 Commit-2** (`build-os/receipts/P-011-album-delta-consolidation.md`).
  `next_pass_planner.py::_album_outlier_item` now applies `round(value, 2)` to the
  `"Album coherence"` **DISPLAY** delta text. **Display-only** — the outlier
  threshold logic still uses full precision (`0.151` trips `0.15`). Commit-2
  `ea9bebf`; 4 float-round tests in `tests/test_album_context.py`.
- **Album cross-song coherence** — **DONE via P-010**
  (`build-os/receipts/P-010-album-context-into-planning.md`).
  **MILESTONE — the cross-song coherence axis is now OPEN.** `analyze()` gained an
  opt-in `album_context: {brightness_delta, lufs_delta}`; an album-outlier song
  (thresholds 0.15 brightness / 3 LUFS, verbatim from `album.py:61,63`, not
  imported) receives ONE bounded, advisory, evidence-tagged `"Album coherence"`
  next-pass item at priority 45 (below every truth move — can never outrank Vocal),
  via a pure `_album_outlier_item`. The `album` CLI is now two-pass (pass 1 = album
  means via `analyze_album`; pass 2 = re-run each song with its derived delta) so
  the album report shows album-aware per-song guidance. **A song's plan now
  reflects its album siblings — the product is no longer strictly song-isolated.**
  Commits `dc61f20` (planner+pipeline+test, 10 tests) and `9ebd4ee` (CLI two-pass+
  test, 2 tests); suite 143→**155**; regression 68/68 held; Commit-1 green in
  isolation. NOTE: P-010 left the album means in two places — **resolved by P-011**.
- **Richer variant→track attribution** — **DONE via P-001**
  (`build-os/receipts/P-001-resolve-variant-track-attribution.md`).
- **Net-new `EVENT_TYPES` decision-ledger vocabulary** — **DONE via P-002**
  (`build-os/receipts/P-002-event-types-vocabulary.md`). `EVENT_TYPES` in
  `constants.py`, optional validated `event_type` on `add_decision`,
  `record_plan_decisions` tags `mute_candidate`, new test added.
- **Readiness-vs-refusal ledger-status UI clarity** — **DONE via P-003**
  (`build-os/receipts/P-003-readiness-vs-refusal-clarity.md`). Labelled
  `READY TO STOP` / `NOT YET — keep iterating` blocks in
  `operator_view.py::render_status` and the `html_dashboard.py` governance card,
  sourced from `result.governance["stop_conditions"]`; 5 new render-only tests.
  Render-only; no backend reach-in.
- **Event-tagging follow-up (from P-002) — in-scope part** — **DONE via P-004**
  (`build-os/receipts/P-004-event-tagging-mix-decision.md`). The one existing
  untagged ledger write (`cowork.py::_write_mix_decision`) now passes
  `event_type="mix_decision"`. **EVENT_TYPES is now applied to every EXISTING
  ledger write:** `mute_candidate` (via P-002's `record_plan_decisions`) and
  `mix_decision` (via P-004's `_write_mix_decision`). The other vocabulary
  members (`taste_feedback` / `validation_check` / `revert` / `manual_note`) have
  no existing producer and are tracked as net-new packets under Deferred above —
  NOT part of this DONE item.
- **`creative_renderer` readiness follow-up (from P-003)** — **DONE via P-005**
  (`build-os/receipts/P-005-creative-renderer-readiness.md`).
  `creative_renderer.py::render_governance`'s `## Stop Conditions` section now
  renders P-003's labelled `READY TO STOP` / `NOT YET — keep iterating` block in
  **markdown** (full `reasons` list, warning-when-ready), replacing the flat
  boolean dump at `creative_renderer.py:104`. Render-only; markdown-clean (no
  HTML); 2 new render-only tests; suite 108→110.
  **MILESTONE — surface consistency closed:** the readiness-vs-refusal treatment
  is now CONSISTENT across all THREE governance surfaces — `operator_view.py`
  (text, P-003), `html_dashboard.py` (HTML, P-003), and `creative_renderer.py`
  (markdown, P-005). The P-003 surface-consistency thread is **fully closed**.
- **`creative.py` literal cleanup** — **DONE via P-006**
  (`build-os/receipts/P-006-creative-literal-cleanup.md`). The two pre-existing
  un-resolved literals in `generate_variants` are now record-backed: Site 1
  (`creative.py:194`, `chorus_lift_B`) `loops or supporting[-1:]` →
  `_resolve(loops, supporting[-1:], [r["name"] for r in records][:1])` (closes the
  empty-`tracks_affected` path, restores P-001's non-empty + real-record-subset
  invariant, reuses the `_resolve` seam); Site 2 (`creative.py:217`, `loop`
  branch) replaces the `"the loop"` literal with a real-record-name fallback.
  Single product commit `6e98a3b`; suite 110→112; 2 new tests.
  **Every `tracks_affected` site in `generate_variants` is now record-backed and
  non-empty**, and loop-branch prose can no longer name a non-existent track
  (except under a degenerate record-free input — see Known risks below).
- **Taste profile feeds governance** — **DONE via P-007**
  (`build-os/receipts/P-007-taste-feeds-governance.md`). The recorded operator
  taste profile (`memory._derive_taste` statements) now **biases variant
  governance** — opt-in, bounded, evidence-tagged. An optional `taste_profile`
  arg (default `None`) on `govern_variant` / `govern_branches` / `run_governance`;
  a pure `_apply_taste` helper + `_TASTE_KIND_BIAS` map (verbatim `_TASTE_MAP`
  statements); `TASTE_MAX_DELTA = 15` (`< 30`, the truth nudge); a
  `taste_adjustments` evidence field present **only** when an adjustment applies.
  Two operators with different taste now get different governed winners from the
  same song (proven: narrower taste flips `chorus_lift_A` → `chorus_lift_C`).
  Single product commit `bd08f28` (`governance.py` +75/−6,
  `tests/test_governance_taste.py` new, 13 tests); suite 112→125; regression
  68/68 held; default path byte-identical (the HARD backward-compat gate).
  **This was the FIRST closure of the learning loop (the *consumer* half).**
- **`drum_room_bloom` narrower-taste test gap (from P-007)** — **DONE via P-008
  (Commit-2 `dbf94c3`).** The `drum_room_bloom` path in
  `governance._TASTE_KIND_BIAS` was data-symmetric with `width_bloom` but
  untested; a mirror of `test_narrower_taste_lowers_width_bloom_identity_bounded`
  was folded into `tests/test_governance_taste.py` (additive). Closed.
- **History-aware next pass (THE OUTCOME SIDE OF THE LEARNING LOOP)** — **DONE via
  P-008** (`build-os/receipts/P-008-history-aware-next-pass.md`). `plan_next_pass`
  now consumes recorded mix-pass history — opt-in, bounded, evidence-tagged. An
  optional trailing `history` arg (default `None` → byte-identical); a
  `_MOVE_TARGET` map bridges history's score-keyed `got_worse` to titled
  candidates; a move whose target regressed AND was recommended last pass is
  **demoted** (`HISTORY_DEMOTE = 40`, floored ≥ 0, survives — not deleted); a
  single non-destructive `"Revert last pass"` move surfaces at priority 95 when
  `revert_candidates` is non-empty; each history-touched candidate carries an
  `evidence` line (absent otherwise). Uses only `history[-1]`. Deterministic.
  Commit-1 `d98a194` (planner + new `tests/test_next_pass_history.py`, 12 tests),
  Commit-2 `dbf94c3` (drum_room_bloom test); suite 125→138; regression 68/68 held;
  default path BYTE-IDENTICAL three ways; Commit-1 green in isolation. Reviewer:
  **pass** (revert at 95>90 ruled acceptable — bounded/non-destructive/cannot
  manufacture a move; Codex not available). **This was the SECOND closure (the
  *outcome* half).**
- **P-007b — Live opt-in taste surface** — **DONE via P-009** (subsumed). The real
  per-operator `taste_profile` from `memory_dir` is now wired into the production
  analysis path: `analyze(..., memory_dir=...)` threads
  `taste_profile()["profile"]` into `run_governance`, and `cowork.py:28` passes
  `memory_dir` so the live `cowork --memory-dir` CLI run personalizes governance.
  The byte-identical-by-default guarantee survives (default `memory_dir=None` →
  `_taste=None` → existing no-op). Receipt:
  `build-os/receipts/P-009-live-wire-memory-into-analyze.md`.
- **P-008b — Live history wire** — **DONE via P-009** (subsumed). `memory.history()`
  is now threaded into `pipeline.analyze()` → `plan_next_pass` so a real recorded
  history reaches the planner in production; the live `cowork --memory-dir` run
  history-demotes regressed moves / surfaces revert. The byte-identical-by-default
  guarantee survives (default `memory_dir=None` → `_history=None` → existing
  no-op). Receipt: `build-os/receipts/P-009-live-wire-memory-into-analyze.md`.
- **Live wire — real memory into the production analysis path (THE LOOP IS NOW
  REAL IN PRODUCTION)** — **DONE via P-009**
  (`build-os/receipts/P-009-live-wire-memory-into-analyze.md`). `analyze()` gained
  an opt-in trailing `memory_dir`; when set it builds `ProjectMemory` once and
  threads `history()` → `plan_next_pass` and `taste_profile()["profile"]` →
  `run_governance`; `cowork.py:28` passes `memory_dir` so the pre-existing CLI
  `cowork --memory-dir` chain is live. Single product commit `27bfebf`; suite
  138→**143**; regression 68/68 held; **default path BYTE-IDENTICAL** (full
  `ProjectAnalysis` exact string-equal three ways — the `"evidence"` keys are
  pre-existing baseline fields, not a leak); Commit-1 green in isolation; safety
  grep clean. Reviewer: **pass** (taste axis ruled genuinely live — flows e2e +
  lowers identity; no winner flip on this fixture is a data property, decision-level
  flip proven by P-007's unit test on the same `analyze()`-driven path; Codex not
  available).
  **MAJOR MILESTONE — THE LEARNING LOOP IS NOW REAL IN PRODUCTION.** A real
  `cowork --memory-dir` run both **learns** (records → history-aware next pass)
  and **personalizes** (taste → governance). P-009 subsumes and completes
  **P-007b + P-008b**. The full arc **P-007 (consumer) → P-008 (outcome) → P-009
  (live wire)** is closed end-to-end.

## Stale / not-real (verified by orchestrator — do NOT act on as written)

- The following inherited follow-ups reference architecture that has **ZERO
  matches in this repo** and should be treated as stale: `LogicActionPayload`
  (multi-parameter), a real adapter narrowing `supported_action_types`,
  `RealLogicSessionAdapter`, dead `_RISK_HINTS` cleanup, adding to an existing
  `EVENT_TYPES` enum, full `Gravito` adapter, standalone `compare-variants`
  alias. That architecture does not exist here — verified by grep (0 matches).
  NOTE: P-002 delivered `EVENT_TYPES` as **net-new** flat vocabulary (not "added
  to an existing enum"); the stale "existing enum" framing remains wrong.
- A prior chat handoff referenced git state (a `main` branch, PR #12, branch
  `claude/hardening-11-…`) that does NOT match this repo on disk — there is no
  `main`; default is `claude/dreamy-turing-z0oxll`. Treat any inherited
  SHA/PR/packet-number claims as unverified until checked against `git`.

## Known risks / debt

- **Variant-scoring path is golden-unguarded (reinforced by P-012, P-015):**
  `regression.py` reads `doctrine_score`, never `score_variant`, so the 68/68
  golden cannot catch a `creative.py`/`score_variant` change. **Unit + visibility
  + flip tests are the binding guard** for any creative-scoring touch (P-012's
  `tests/test_creative_nudges.py` safety-invariant suite, P-013's
  `tests/test_creative_nudge_visibility.py` driving the live `analyze()` path, and
  P-015's `tests/test_decisive_nudge.py` pinning the masked-vocal flip). Treat any
  future creative-scoring change as test-binding, not golden-binding. Watch-item:
  P-015's flip margin is thin (0.2) but fully pinned — a future re-curation would
  surface as a RED test, not a silent re-rank.
- **Degenerate empty-`records` input (low priority — NOT a packet yet):** under a
  truly **empty** `records` list (an unconstructible / degenerate input on the
  engine path), P-006's Site 1 still returns `[]` and Site 2 still yields
  `"the loop"`. Acknowledged by the reviewer as out-of-scope — a possible future
  guard, not a defect. Raise as a packet only if a record-free engine path
  becomes constructible.
- Test env: numpy + pytest are not preinstalled. The full suite requires
  `pip install -e ".[dev]"` from `logic-mix-os/` (a network install) before
  `python -m pytest`.
- **Commits on this branch are unsigned.** The configured SSH signing key
  (`/home/claude/.ssh/commit_signing_key.pub`) is an empty 0-byte file and the
  container runs as `root`, so signing is impossible. Author + committer are
  correctly `noreply@anthropic.com`; GitHub will show these commits as
  "Unverified" (missing signature only, not a misattribution). This is an
  environment limitation, not a fix-it item.

## Open boundaries (awaiting explicit go)

- **P-029's product commits `42d6ebd`, `ea1aaa9` are local-only as of this close**
  (this archivist close did not push). They sit on the dev branch
  `claude/logic-mix-os-hardening-12-7hbeh1` on top of the `e79426a` (PR #16) merge
  base — THE PIVOT: `analyze(producer=…)` selects the profile (byte-identical by
  default). The build-os-only close commit is separate. The accumulated
  producer-agnostic epic (P-025 → P-029) plus the earlier local-only arc remain
  un-landed on default. Any push of the product commits — and any subsequent PR /
  merge into the protected default — needs the user's explicit go. No push / merge /
  deploy / secret action taken in this close.

- **P-017 closed with NO product-code change (verified negative finding).** The
  ONLY committed change is the tests-only characterization guard
  (`tests/test_density_recuration.py`, commit `1b03ad3`) plus the `fecc4e5`
  active-packet confirmation and this build-os close. All sit on the dev branch
  `claude/logic-mix-os-hardening-12-7hbeh1` on top of the `6c40e2b` (PR #15) merge.
  **`1b03ad3` is local-only at this close.** Any push of it — and any subsequent
  PR / merge into the protected default — needs the user's explicit go. No push /
  merge / deploy / secret action taken in this close.
- **P-016 is now MERGED to default via PR #15** (merge commit `6c40e2b`, the current
  default-branch tip and the base for P-017). The earlier P-016 dev commits
  (`b15b957`, `a9f4e26`) are landed on default via that merge. That boundary is
  resolved. (Earlier stale note said "P-016 local-only on `0f4e7e9`" — superseded.)
- **P-014 closed with NO product/test commit (verified negative finding).** Only
  the build-os memory advance (this close) and the prior `596174d` active-packet
  confirmation sit on the dev branch `claude/logic-mix-os-hardening-12-7hbeh1` on
  top of the `0f4e7e9` merge. Nothing product-side to push. Any push, and any
  subsequent PR / merge into the protected default, needs the user's explicit go.
  No push / merge / deploy / secret action taken in this close.
- **PR #13 is MERGED** (merge commit `0f4e7e9`) — the earlier local-only product
  commits (P-005…P-012: `0df436c`, `effccd0`, `ea9bebf`, `dc61f20`, `9ebd4ee`,
  `27bfebf`, etc.) are now landed on the default branch via that merge. That
  boundary is resolved.
- **P-013's tests-only product commit `172cfd0` is local-only as of this close**
  (this archivist close did not push). It sits on the dev branch
  `claude/logic-mix-os-hardening-12-7hbeh1` on top of the `0f4e7e9` merge. Any push
  of it — and any subsequent PR / merge into the protected default — needs the
  user's explicit go. No push / merge / deploy / secret action taken in this close.
- **P-015's product commit `1756f61` is local-only as of this close** (this
  archivist close did not push). It sits on the dev branch
  `claude/logic-mix-os-hardening-12-7hbeh1` on top of the `0f4e7e9` merge — the
  user-signed-off masked-vocal-nudge change. The orchestrator pushes the dev branch
  separately. Any push of it — and any subsequent PR / merge into the protected
  default — needs the user's explicit go. No push / merge / deploy / secret action
  taken in this close.

- **P-019's product commits `b7572b7`, `de5679f` are local-only as of this close**
  (this archivist close did not push). They sit on the dev branch
  `claude/logic-mix-os-hardening-12-7hbeh1` on top of the `6c40e2b` (PR #15) merge
  base — the additive `record_mix_pass` cowork command (byte-identical by default).
  The build-os-only close commit is separate. Any push of the product commits — and
  any subsequent PR / merge into the protected default — needs the user's explicit
  go. No push / merge / deploy / secret action taken in this close.

- **P-020's product commit `942a68a` is local-only as of this close** (this
  archivist close did not push). It sits on the dev branch
  `claude/logic-mix-os-hardening-12-7hbeh1` on top of the `6c40e2b` (PR #15) merge
  base — the additive, read-only `describe_session` cowork command + `_SESSION_FLOW`
  (byte-identical to every existing command). The build-os-only close commit is
  separate. Any push of the product commit — and any subsequent PR / merge into the
  protected default — needs the user's explicit go. No push / merge / deploy / secret
  action taken in this close.

- **P-021's tests-only commit `dce156b` is local-only as of this close** (this
  archivist close did not push). It sits on the dev branch
  `claude/logic-mix-os-hardening-12-7hbeh1` on top of the `6c40e2b` (PR #15) merge
  base — the MILESTONE end-to-end walkthrough (adds exactly one file
  `tests/test_cowork_session_walkthrough.py`, +372; no product/runtime change, no
  existing test edited). The build-os-only close commit is separate. Any push of the
  commit — and any subsequent PR / merge into the protected default — needs the
  user's explicit go. No push / merge / deploy / secret action taken in this close.

- **P-025's product commits `195127c`, `e6cb038` are local-only as of this close**
  (this archivist close did not push). They sit on the dev branch
  `claude/logic-mix-os-hardening-12-7hbeh1` on top of the `e79426a` (PR #16) merge
  base — the `ProducerProfile` schema + `load_profile()` + extracted
  `halee_ramone.json` reference (data + loader + tests only; COMPLETELY UNWIRED —
  the four judgment sources byte-unchanged, regression 68/68 UNCHANGED). The
  build-os-only close commit is separate. Any push of the product commits — and any
  subsequent PR / merge into the protected default — needs the user's explicit go.
